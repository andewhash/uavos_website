# AP 10.1

**Automatic Control System for UAV with a takeoff weight of 100 kg up to 4000 kg**

---

## Overview

The Automatic Control System (AP) provides the hardware and vehicle control abstraction layer for the host platform, enabling fully autonomous operation.  

All flight systems — including take-off, landing, navigation and mission execution — can be initiated with a single keystroke.  

Diagnostics, flight mission planning and remote control can all be achieved wirelessly.

A notable feature of the AP is its **distributed architecture**:

- Each component has a dedicated microcontroller.
- Communication between components is via the CAN bus.
- Decentralized configuration reduces central processor loading.
- No restriction on the number of same-type modules — supports multiple redundancy at all levels.
- Nearly all payloads or third-party modules can be integrated into the AP.

## Flexibility & Scalability

- Can be used in a wide range of vehicles: from small quadcopters to full-size converted piloted aircraft.  
- Redundant layering ensures basic functionality even in case of failures.  
- Ground control software is multi-platform and supports both WAN and LAN operation.  
- Custom payloads/sensors can be integrated by scripting protocols through onboard **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.

## Compatibility

The AP is compatible with almost any vehicle configuration:

- VTOLs  
- USVs  
- UGVs  
- Non-traditional aircraft concepts  

Key algorithm: **Total Energy Control System (TECS)** for improved reliability and failure handling:  
- Automatic landing with engine failure  
- Auto-rotation for helicopters  
- Parachute deployment  

The AP is also:  
- **Resilient against jamming**  
- Supports **precise dead-reckoning navigation** in absence of GNSS
